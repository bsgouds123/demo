I'm working with several repositories, but lately I was just working in our internal one and all was great.

Today I had to commit and push code into other one, but I'm having some troubles.

$ git push appharbor master
error: The requested URL returned error: 403 while accessing https://gavekortet@appharbor.com/mitivo.git/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack
fatal: HTTP request failed
There is nothing I can do, that would bring the password entry again.

How can I reset the credentials on my system so Git will ask me for the password of that repository?

I have tried:

git config --global --unset core.askpass
in order to unset the password

git config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=1'
in order to avoid credentials cache...

Nothing seems to work; does anyone have a better idea?
